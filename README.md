Resonable

Resonable is a set of resonable defaults for Neovim. Consider it a slightly
more verbose companion to sensible.vim. With a moustache. And a sports car. And
you can tell it works out, but not in a way that makes it look like there was
any effort, just that You Know.

Intended to be used via Vim Plug or your favorate Git-cloning Vim addon
manager.
